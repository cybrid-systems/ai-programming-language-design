# 40-thp -- Transparent Huge Pages analysis

> Based on Linux 7.0-rc1

## 0. Overview

THP automatically promotes 4KB pages to 2MB huge pages, reducing TLB misses.

## 1. Configuration

/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled: [always] madvise never

## 2. khugepaged

Background thread scanning memory for promotion candidates.

## 3. Benefits

4KB: 2MB/TLB, 512 PTEs/GB
2MB: 1GB/TLB, 1 PMD/GB

## 4. vs hugetlbfs

THP: automatic, swappable
hugetlbfs: manual reservation, not swappable

## 5. Kernel config

CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE=y
CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE_MADVISE=y

## 6. Source files

mm/huge_memory.c, mm/khugepaged.c
