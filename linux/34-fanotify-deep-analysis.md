# 34-fanotify-deep -- fanotify internals

> Based on Linux 7.0-rc1

## 0. Overview

Deep dive into fanotify permission decision mechanism and notification groups.

## 1. Permission event handling

fanotify_perm_event: response, pid, wait_queue_head_t

## 2. FAN_CLASS_CONTENT caching

Content mode caches file data for scanner access.

## 3. Performance

Non-permission: ~1us per event
Permission: ~100us-10ms (blocking)

## 4. Kernel config

CONFIG_FANOTIFY=y
CONFIG_FANOTIFY_ACCESS_PERMISSIONS=y
