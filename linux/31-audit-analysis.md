# 31-audit -- Linux kernel audit subsystem analysis

> Based on Linux 7.0-rc1

## 0. Overview

The Linux Audit subsystem provides system call auditing. It captures security-relevant events and sends structured records to userspace auditd. Widely used for SELinux, AppArmor integration, and compliance.

## 1. Core data structures

struct audit_context:
- major: syscall number
- argv[6]: syscall arguments
- return_code: return value
- names: path names

## 2. System call audit flow

audit_syscall_entry -> syscall execution -> audit_syscall_exit -> audit_filter -> audit_log_start -> audit_log_end -> netlink -> auditd

## 3. Audit rules

auditctl -a always,exit -S open -S openat -F key=file_ops
auditctl -w /etc/shadow -p wa

## 4. Performance

Simple audit: ~2-5us per syscall
Buffer limit: 64 events default
Loss counter: atomic_t audit_lost

## 5. Configuration

/etc/audit/auditd.conf: log_file, max_log_file, flush, space_left_action

## 6. Netlink protocol

NETLINK_AUDIT protocol family. audit_send_list uses nlmsg_multicast.

## 7. Buffer management

per-CPU audit_buffer cache reduces allocation overhead.

## 8. Filter types

USER, TASK, ENTRY, WATCH, EXIT

## 9. Backlog control

When auditd can't keep up, events are dropped.

## 10. Summary

audit provides kernel-level event tracing with netlink transport.
